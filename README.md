# Logical model of hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in Ewing sarcoma
This repository aims to share the logical model and the resulting data regarding the hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in Ewing sarcoma.

## Requirements

The model is provided in a .zginml file. It can be read by GINsim software or by the ginsim package in Python language.

> [GINsim software](https://ginsim.org/)

> [GINsim-python](https://github.com/GINsim/GINsim-python)


## Simulations

The simulations were performed with the use of a user-friendly graphical interface provided by GINsim in Java. The following tools were used:

> Compute stable states

> Analyse circuits
